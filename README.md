# ML-Audio-Project
 I have uploaded the trained weights labeled as audio_final_cnn.pth, and the test file as a CSV file named kaggle_test.csv. This project was completed as a part of a machine learning class final project, and the dataset was provided as such by the course instructors. Hence, as I am unsure if I am allowed to upload the full data files as they might be propreitary data, the training and testing audio files have not been uploaded to the repository. If you do want the access to the specific datasets, please let me know and I will ask the course instructors for permission to share it. 

The main function in the ipynb file is used for training, and predict function is used for test.
